This is a university project for my Computer Engeneering thesis that aims to demonstrate the implementation of a secure platform for users to access and share content while ensuring their privacy using Passkey authentication.
    
    The data collected is used exclusively to manage user access to the site and ensure a safe browsing experience. User data is not sold, shared, or distributed to third parties. RAW does not store images or other multimedia files on our servers. Any images or content displayed through the site are linked to third-party services. We are not responsible for the content or management of these files by third-party platforms.

WARNING: Passkey sign-up is not implemented yet so to use passkey create a profile with username and password first. From there you can test otp functionality as well as passkeys.

    To test it by yourself:
      1. clone this repository
      2. highly suggested to create a virtuale enviroment, 'pipenv' was used during developement
      3. if you have decided to use pipenv enter the virtual enviroment
         $ pipenv shell
      4. install all required packages, they are stored in the requirements.txt file
         $ pip install -r requirements.txt
      5. start the server
         $ python manage.py runserver
      6. to test it go to http://localhost:8000
         i know that tecnically localhost:8000 and 127.0.0.1:8000 are almost the same, 
         but localhost is recognised as a trusted source, 127.0.0.1:8000 is not and webauth features would not work
